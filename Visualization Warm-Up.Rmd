## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
[text](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/voters/)
```

**What is the data that are being visualized? Where did it come from?
The graph shows Donald Trump's approval and disapproval rating. The user can change the selection group from all polls, polls of likely or registered voters and polls of adults. The graph accounts for uncertaininty in Trump's rating (due to polling methods, the passing of time ect). It provides a range for the approval and disapproval ratings show with the green and orange bands. The information comes from polls. However, this graph is unique in that it does not weigh all polls equally. It weighs polls based on their methodological standards and adjusts for polls that consistently show opposing information. 

**Which data dimensions are mapped to which visual cues?


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
